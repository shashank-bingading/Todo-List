A straightforward task management app built using React for seamless UI updates and state handling. The codebase leverages React hooks to manage task lists dynamically, providing real-time addition and removal of to-do items. The UI is styled with modular CSS for a clean, responsive look. All user actions (adding, deleting, marking tasks) are handled client-side, ensuring fast feedback and no page reloads. The project structure follows best practices for component organization, making the codebase easy to extend or integrate with backends like Node.js or Firebase if needed.
